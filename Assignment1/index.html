      1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?
    </p>
    <p class="first-answer" id="Answer">
      When I started to open up the web, the first thing I saw was the words
      that came all across the browser, with four Pallet colors. Yellow on top
      left, Aqua on top right, dark pink at bottom left, and purple in the
      bottom right. Scrolling down is the triangle inside of the triangle is the
      world “Div center Perfectly” which is clearly divided perfectly. Scrolling
      down more is a “Pixel Displacement Effect”. Under it is a pixelated
      picture of a mountain, and Contact information is at the bottom of the
      site.

      2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions
    </p>
    <p class="first-part-of-the-answer">
      In the first part of the site with 4 color pallate:
    </p>
    <ul class="first-slot-of-the-answer">
      <li>+The most attention detail is the cursor that affects the site.</li>
      <li>
        + When you move around the site, it will decrease the size of 3 colors
        in favor of the others
      </li>
      <li>
        + and depending on which color you move, the color of the text will
        change, including some of the world, the emphasis on the creator
        movement and ideas.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="second-part-of-the-answer">
      In the second part of the site ( div center perfectly ):
    </p>
    <ul class="second-slot-of-the-answer">
      <li>
        + The triangle rotates upside down when you hover the cursor on it.
      </li>
      <li>
        + The world will start to change positions from “Div center Perfectly”
        to “Perfectly div center”
      </li>
      <li>+ Creating illusional effects on the viewers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="third-part-of-the-answer">
      In the third part of the site (pixel displacement effect):
    </p>
    <ul class="third-slot-of-the-answer">
      <li>+ In the third part of the site (pixel displacement effect)</li>
      <li>+ Creating a surrounding empty space around the cursor</li>
      <li>+ When u move away of that empty space, it will return to normal</li>
      <li>
        + When you hover around the words, they will start to move and change
        position on each other
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="conclution-of-the-second-answer">
      The other thing that I realized is that when you resize the browser, the
      site's mechanic itself will change from cursor hovering to clicking
      interaction. However, it only affects the first part of the websites.
    </p>
    <p class="third-question" id="question">
      3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </p>
    <p class="third-answer" id="Answer">
      While engaging the site, most of my time that I engage with the website is
      the first part and the third part of the website. Even if the second part
      is good with the way it look, however the second part of the website
      activities is quite dull, there is lack of navigation round the second
      part of the websites, the first part and the final part of the sites is
      more interactive and more attracting, the creative that the those 2 part
      bring is what make me spend most of my times on those websites.

    <p class="fourth-question" id="question">
      4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </p>
    <p class="fourth-answer" id="Answer">
      The most common actions while interacting with the experience is mostly
      hovering my cursor around the site, i think that is the primary
      interaction of the websites. Beside that, when you scroll down, the only
      thing that I can interact with is only the contact of the websites. They
      are represented as a link to contact the creator of the websites.
    </p>
    <p class="fifth-question">
      5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </p>
    <p class="fifth-answer" id="Answer">
      My first impression of the interactive experience is to create illusion
      and create new ways of interactions. Since most of the websites itself is
      to showcase the unique design style and also showcase his skill in
      frontend development are interactive by clicking, the creator is trying to
      bring the elusive style of making the website. The Abstract in the
      beginning, showing the different art of styles. Making the users focus and
      explore the website.
    </p>
    <p class="sixth-question" id="question">
      6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </p>
    <p class="sixth-answer" id="Answer">
      The website itself communicate the goal by using the hovering mechanic, It
      affected on the illusions of the websites, creating the curiosity affect
      in the mind of the users, it is a clever way of keeping the users to
      explore more about the websites, Moreover, the second element of the
      website is the color palate at the first part of the website, the
      illusions of colors is the strong point, making the website “Interesting”.
      The experience feels carefully curated, and must be likely aimed at
      potential collaborators, employers, or clients in the creative tech space.
    </p>
    <p class="seventh-question" id="question">
      7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </p>
    <p class="seventh-answer" id="Answer">
      For me, my impression of the experience is 2-4 minutes short, there are
      only 3 panels in the experience, and each of them took only 15-20 seconds
      max. The content is fully absorbed in one sitting rather than revisited
      multiple times Even the experience’s illustrations and effects are great.
      But the lack of activities and features created the boredom of the sites,
      making the sites goal to be repeatedly visited. The site itself is quite  
      lacking content, or ongoing engagement. Instead, the site feels like a
      planted Illustration and creative impression. Users are likely to expect
      to be returning back to the website.
    </p>
    <p class="eight-question" id="question">
      8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </p>
    <p class="eight-answer" >
      For me,The lack of attraction is the main reason for the interactive
      experiences should be adding more activities for users to interact with.
      Instead of only 3 panels, the creator can create more panels for the
      experience:
    </p>
    <ul class="eight-slot-answer">
      <li>+ Explaining the progress</li>
      <li>+ Blog posts, update vlogs</li>
      <li>+ There is no login or notification system</li>
      <li>+ Besides hovering, clicking on features is also an options</li>
      <li>+ References</li>
      <li>+ Creating more effects for the users interaction</li>
      <li>+ Explaining the ideas behind the ideas</li>
      <li>+ Creating Minigames</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="eight-answer-conclusion">
      The lack of diversity for the experience is the missing key element for
      the experiences. If the creator can keep the “interesting” key point to
      the experiences than i think it is the diversity is something need to be
    </p>
    <p class="ninth-question" id="question">
      9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </p>
    <p class="ninth-answer" id="Answer">
      The media forms, particularly experimental graphic design, digital art,
      and a little bit of modern web-based motion graphics. Bold typography,
      good layouts, the animated transitions reflect influences from the
      editorial spreads. It also references interactive media like video games
      or art installations. Overall, it feels like a blend of digital portfolio,
      art gallery and modern design magazine merged into an interactive format
    </p>
    <p class="tenth-question" id="question">
      10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
    <p class="tenth-answer" id="Answer" >
      The references communicate to me that I should approach the experience
      with a creative mindset and be more open to the information that needs to
      be obtained. The artist. It encourages me to slow down, to observe the
      details, and to appreciate the aesthetics as a part of the message. It is
      for me how to form and presentate the influence of meaning.
    </p>
    <p class="eleventh-question" id="question">
      11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
    <p class="eleventh-answer" id="Answer">
      The references to digital art, and approach with interactive installations
      communicate that I should feel inspired, curious, and creative when I am
      interacting with the experience. The site has emotional and aesthetic
      appreciation, rather than just analytical thinking. It creates the sense
      of exploration by encouraging the feeling of being immersive. Open to
      unconventional forms of communication. This creates the tone of
      traditional and academic where feeling and intuition are important as
      critical analysis.

    <p class="twelveth-question" id="question">
      12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </p>
    <p class="twelveth-answer" id="Answer">
      The most frustrating part of the interaction for me is the site’s
      navigation and pacing, which can create disorientation at times. The heavy
      use of animation and the visual layout choices are visually impressive but
      sometimes it makes it difficult to understand, especially where to click
      or what needs to be done to go through the content. Overloading the flow
      of the experience, creating distraction on finding the information like
      Contacting details or project descriptions. The frustration of the
      interfaces of the experience instead of guide smoothly through it.
    </p>
    <p class="thirdteen-question" id="question">
      13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </p>
    <p class="thirdteen-answer" id="Answer">
      The most satisfying part of the interaction must be the visuals and the
      motion designing of the interaction, especially the smooth transition, and
      the layout choices are really good and satisfying. Every scroll or
      hovering is very intentional in its own way of design, the animation is
      carefully crafted in a way of playful and polished. The satisfying part is
      how they can turn a simple design into an immersive experience. There’s a
      very strong sense of personality and artistry of the sites, giving us the
      feeling of stepping through a living world of cyber-fantasy.
